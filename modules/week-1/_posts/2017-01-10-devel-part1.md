# Your Development Environment, Cont'd

In addition to a CLI (i.e. Terminal.app or Git-Bash.exe), you also should have a ready-to-go development environment on your machine. This environment should include;

- A Text Editor. Such as;
    - GitHub’s [Atom](https://atom.io) - Open Source (ie. Free)
    - Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Open Source
    - Adobe’s [Brackets](http://brackets.io) - Open Source
    - [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) - License is $70
- A way of working with GIT. Either via;
    - A CLI, such as Terminal.app or Git-Bash.exe
        - You would use Git with CLI commands (i.e. `git commit -m "some message"`)
    - A Git GUI App, such as;
        - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (recommended)
        - [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)
- A GitHub account
    - [github.com](https://github.com)
- Modern web browsers for testing
    - Chrome
    - Safari
    - Firefox

If you have taken _MART341_ recently or _MART120 - Creative Coding 1_, you should be all setup and ready to go. If any of this feels unfamiliar, you need to install these tools, or you want a refresher, I would suggest you work through the content for "week 2" of Creative Coding 1.
