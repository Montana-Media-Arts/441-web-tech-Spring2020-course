# Homework

For your homework this week, you will conclude on your choose your own adventure story.  Now, you will give the user a choice and depending on the choice entered into a text box, you will print out the next part of the story.  You should go through at least 5 sections of your story here.  Feel free to create functions, you will need if/else statements.  At the end, you should ask the user if they want to start again.

Next week, we will start on a new game that incorporates all the rest of the loops, the math functions, etc.

For example, you might do something like this:

1. You are driving down a dirt road heading nowhere in particular.  You come to a T in the road.  Which way do you go?  Go left? Go Right?

2. If the user chooses Left, you can say something like "You go to the left and find a quaint restaurant in which you decide to stop and eat.  You get some chicken fried steak."  

3. If the user choose Right, you can say something like "You go to the right and drive for hours and hours and run out of fuel. You are lost and not sure what to do next.

4. Those are the decisions, you will update div tags or span tags depending on the choices they make.  

5. You will also update your styling and your images depending on the decision that are made.  Before you say, "Whoa!  You haven't shown us that yet.. you are right!  However, if you remember how to access the DOM, getElementById, you can do the same thing by accessing your style tag.  **Hint** check this out: [Updating CSS from JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_css.asp)
