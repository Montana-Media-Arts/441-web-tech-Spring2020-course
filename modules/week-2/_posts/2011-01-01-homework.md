# Homework 2

For your homework this week, I want you to create a basic web page, that uses the console.log and adds some comments. You are welcome to make something display on the page like an image or something.

1. The log should should be executed from a separate JavaScript file, that you link to from your html document.
    - Use the script tag at the end of your HTML document to do this
2. The console.log should include;
    - 3 of your favorite restaurants
    - 3 of your favorite snack foods
    - 3 of your favorite fruits and/or vegetables
    (see the theme of the week)
3. You should set a basic background color for your document using a style element within the HTML documents head element.

As always, you should also write a readme.md that is part of your directory. Here you should discuss your progress this week with the introduction to JS and your console example.

Your directory should look like the following;

```
Git-Repo
├── HW-1/
├── HW-2/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── readme.md
│   └── script.js
├── README.md
└── index.html
```

Also, you will  answer the question in the week-2 Moodle forum, and submit your links in the homework area in Moodle.  Feel free to paste your links into a file (docx, PDF, etc) and submit that into Moodle.
