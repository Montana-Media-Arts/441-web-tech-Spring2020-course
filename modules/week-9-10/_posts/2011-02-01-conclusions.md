# Conclusions

Okay, so I get it. It was a lot this week!  We definitely went through some more advanced concepts.  As such, we are going to take our time and make sure everyone is on board with this material.  We are going to make sure that you can go back and review and see how this fits in with what we did before.  Please take some time to go back to previous weeks if you need to and review.  Then, work on the homework.  I would like to give you more time than less before we move on.  We will start after Spring Break with some new material on HTML5 and gaming, but for now, I want you to work with AJAX, jQuery, JSON, and jQuery plugins to become comfortable and confident.
