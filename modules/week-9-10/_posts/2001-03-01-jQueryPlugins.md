# jQuery Plugins

Let's switch gears now and utilize some of the jQuery plugins that are out there.  What is a jQuery plugin?  These are further abstractions of jQuery to make some effect.  This means someone has created a custom function using jQuery and then all you have to do is reference the plugin and call the function to utilize it.  That is a good thing!  Let's look at some examples:

There are ones that allow us to scroll through pictures in a different way.

[Tilted Scroll](http://www.thepetedesign.com/demos/tiltedpage_scroll_demo.html)

There are ones that do face detection.

There are ones that help make our menus look a little nicer.

[Slinky Menu](https://github.com/alizahid/slinky)

Ones that help with lettering.

And ones that even help with popups so they look better and keep us on the page.

The are so many more and I encourage you to check them out as they will help you give your users an even richer experience.  Many of them have demos and even though they might look a little complicated at first as you dig through them, you will realize that you know more than you think!
