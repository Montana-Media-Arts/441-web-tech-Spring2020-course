# Weekly Conclusions

This week, we covered some more advanced topics including handing web state with query strings and cookies and arrays.  We also discussed debugging which is important for all developers.  Next week, we will look at more array concepts along with Object Oriented Programming, and JSON objects.  This will give us some background on where we want to go and how to really increase our reusability.  As always, please let me know if you have any questions!
