# Arrays

Simply put, arrays are collections.  My guess is that you already know what an array is in real life.  Think about in terms in an array of movies, music, art, books, etc.  These are all arrays or collections.  So, that's all it is.  Not scary!

In programming, arrays allow us to hold a lot of information and have only 1 variable.  Think about that for a second. If I were to ask you to create 50 variables, how enthusiastic would you be?  Think about your last homework.  How many variables, methods, etc did you have to make?  Was it a struggle to keep things straight?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you were not alone.

This is where arrays come in and can help make things easier.  Remember, we want to reduce maintenance and increase reusability.  Arrays help with that too!

So, how are they defined in code?

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Arrays</title>
        <script>
            function printArray()
            {
                var food = ["apple", "orange", "grape"];
                var allFoods = "";
                for(var i = 0; i < food.length; i++)
                {
                    allFoods += food[i] + "<br>";
                }
                document.getElementById("myFoods").innerHTML = allFoods;
            }
        </script>
    </head>
    <body onload="printArray();">
        <div id="myFoods"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

This is a classic example of creating an array by setting aside 3 memory locations, with 3 values containing all strings (because arrays hold the same type). As you can see though, there is one variable that allow us to access three different values instead of having three different variables.  Cool huh?

We can also create arrays by create an instance of the Array class.  I know we haven't formally talked about classes and objects, we have actually used one class already.  The Math class.  We just didn't create instances of it.

What is a class and an object you ask?  Simply put, a class is a generic template and an object is a specific instance of that class.  You can think of it like this.  You can have a Person (the class).  All people have some number of eyes, ears, arms, legs, color of hair, color of eyes, height, weight, etc.  A specific person (the object) who has 2 eyes, 2 ears, 2 arms, 1 leg, brown hair, green eyes, 6 ft tall, 240 lbs.  Does that make sense?  If not complete sense, we will cover this in more detail later.

However, in code, it looks something like this

```html
<html>

    <head>
        <title>Arrays</title>
        <script>
            function printArray()
            {
                var food = new Array("apple", "orange", "grape");
                var allFoods = "";
                for(var i = 0; i < food.length; i++)
                {
                    allFoods += food[i] + "<br>";
                }
                document.getElementById("myFoods").innerHTML = allFoods;
            }
        </script>
    </head>
    <body onload="printArray();">
        <div id="myFoods"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

If you run the code, the result is the same.  So, what is the difference you ask?  Not a whole lot.  It's just two different ways to create arrays.

Now, there should be something I did that should be interesting to you.  How did I get the information out of the array?  I used the **[]** brackets.

```html
  var food1 = food[0];
```

This says get the first element in the array.  Keep in mind that all arrays start at zero and go up to the size of the array minus 1.

What if I want to make a change to an element in an array?

The nice part is that I can use the same syntax and just assign it.  It looks like this

```html
  food[0] = "peaches";
```
Now, instead of apples in the first element, it has peaches.

Something to note, another way to specify an element in an array is to call it the **index** of the array.

There are a couple of special properties and methods that go along with arrays.  One property is called **length**.  That returns how large the array is.  If you remember from above, the for loop went up to, but didn't include the length of the array.  That is because it started at zero and can only access the index that is one less than the total size. So, in this case 2.  It counts as 3 elements, it's just that we start at zero.

Another special method is sort. It will sort the array for it.  It looks something like this

```html
<html>

    <head>
        <title>Arrays</title>

        <script>
            function printArray()
            {
                var food = new Array("apple", "orange", "grape");
                food.sort();
                var allFoods = "";
                for(var i = 0; i < food.length; i++)
                {
                    allFoods += food[i] + "<br>";
                }
                document.getElementById("myFoods").innerHTML = allFoods;
            }        
        </script>
    </head>
    <body onload="printArray();">
        <div id="myFoods"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

At first glance, that might not seem like a big deal, but trust me, it's a big deal to have this.  There are classes that are spent on trying to figure out the fastest way to sort information.  So, to have one that is built-in.  Be thankful!

You can also add to an array, but using the push method.  It looks like this

```html
<html>

    <head>
        <title>Arrays</title>

        <script>
            function printArray()
            {
                var food = new Array("apple", "orange", "grape");
                food.push("pear");
                var allFoods = "";
                for(var i = 0; i < food.length; i++)
                {
                    allFoods += food[i] + "<br>";
                }
                document.getElementById("myFoods").innerHTML = allFoods;
            }        
        </script>
    </head>
    <body onload="printArray();">
        <div id="myFoods"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

The nice part was that I didn't have to change my for loop because it uses the length property.  Also, this makes our arrays dynamic which means we can make them grow if more data comes along.

So, how can we create an array of an unknown size?  We will use one more special method called **split**.  This method is called by the string and sends in a delimiter as a parameter to the function.  The delimiter is what separates the strings from one another.  This function returns an array.  What does this look like?

```html
<html>

    <head>
        <title>Arrays</title>

        <script>
            function printArray()
            {
                var friends = "George,Grace,Ella,John,Meghan,Ben";
                var separateFriends = friends.split(",");
                var allFriends = "";
                for(var i = 0; i < separateFriends.length; i++)
                {
                    allFriends += separateFriends[i] + "<br>";
                }
                document.getElementById("myFriends").innerHTML = allFriends;
            }        
        </script>
    </head>
    <body onload="printArray();">
        <div id="myFriends"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Arrays are really, really cool and I hope you learn to really love them.  They are so valuable.

Keep in mind we can do a lot more with arrays, like adding objects, methods, and more, but this hopefully will serve as a nice introduction.
