## Help Procedures

Do the following to get help with problems.

1. Google the problem.
2. Post to the [course issues forum](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/441-WebTech-Spring2019/issues).
    - The advantage to the GitHub issues forum is its advanced system for including formatted code. This will help with problem solving.
3. Go to the [127 Media Arts Lab](#lab-hours)
    - The Media Arts Lab in room 127 of McGill hall has daily "lab monitors" who are hired to assist with problem solving and class help.
    - [Lab Info](#lab-hours).
4. Contact the [Teaching Assistant]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/#TA).
    - The TA for this class should be contacted with content/technical questions, or disputes about grades.
    - They will hold [regular lab hours](#lab-hours) in 127 once a week.
    - They will also monitor the GitHub issues forum.
    - If you need to contact them directly, please use email
        - [TBA](mailto:michael.cassnes@umontana.edu?subject=441%20Question)
5. Get help from [Michael Cassens]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/)
    - If you have a high level problem, or need help that no one can offer, please contact Michael Cassens (me, the one writing all of this).
    - The best way to get a hold of me is to swing by my weekly office hours. These are posted (and updated) under my [office hours section]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/#office-hours). This is the BEST way to work with me. Just come by during one of those posted times.
    - If you are a distance student or cannot make one of those times, please email me. (I will get back to you as soon as I can.  If you don't get a message back from me, please feel free to try again (unless it's the middle of the night -- even then I sometimes respond.  I do try and sleep sometimes))
