# this

On the last page, you learned the basic structure for creating a **constructor** method. At the end of the page, it was mentioned that if there is data specific to the object that will be created from the class, then this should be passed to the constructor as an **input parameter**. What was not discussed, was how to then deal with this input parameter data or where to store it.

To store data inside a specific object, we will use a syntax known as **this**. You can think of it as creating a variable inside the class that we can access later from the object. Whew.. we will look at examples.  I promise!

Let's go back to our Person class. I reduced the number of properties to make it easy to digest.  Let's look at how this might work:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <title>OOP</title>
    <script>
        class Person{
                constructor()
                {
                    this.eyeColor = "blue";
                    this.hairColor = "red";
                }
                showInformation()
                {
                    document.getElementById("person").innerHTML = "Eye Color: " + this.eyeColor + "<br>Hair Color: " + this.hairColor;
                }   
            }
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="test"></div>

</body>
</html>
```
In this code, the class is created and the hair color and eye color **will be** initialized through the constructor.  Notice, nothing has been created yet.  However, the **this** keyword allows us to get the properties in the class.

#### No input parameters to the constructor

You do not need to send any input parameters to the constructor.  This is called the default constructor. This allows you to give `default` values to your properties. 

```js
 class Person{
                constructor()
                {
                   this.eyeColor = "blue";
                   this.hairColor = "red";
                    
                }
            }
        }
```

In this example, `this.eyeColor` will have a value of `blue` and `this.hairColor` will have a value of `red`, which will be attached to any new object instances of class type `Person`.

#### You Will Forget 'this'

Never fear, if you forget **this.**, you are one of many.  This is common.  It will cause errors.  But you are well-equiped to handle errors now that you have debugging skills.  So, just go back to what you know and see what you can figure out.

One more thing though, if you create a variable without the this, it will become a global variable that can be used anywhere.

```js
 class Person{
                constructor()
                {
                   this.eyeColor = "blue";
                    this.hairColor = "red";
                    eyeColor = "green";
                }
            }
        }
```

Remember the property, `this.eyeColor`, will be attached to any new object instances of class type `Person`. However, the eyeColor two lines later creates a new JavaScript global variable, known as 'eyeColor'. This new variable us attached to the JavaScript environment and **NOT** any new `Person` objects.

## Pass Input Parameters to a constructor

To pass any input parameters specified in a _constructor method_ to a new instance of an object, they need to be assigned to **this** properties. The following would take a eyeColor and hairColor value, passed to the `Person` object, and assign it to the object's eyeColor and hairColor properties respectively.

```js
class Person{
                constructor(eyeColor, hairColor)
                {
                    this.eyeColor = eyeColor;
                    this.hairColor = hairColor;
                }
            }
        }
```

The above may look funny. If we can pass input parameters in to the _constructor method_ why should they need to be re-assigned to an object property? There are many reasons for this, but the simplest is that you may not always take a property and assign it like we just did above. It may be used to set something else, etc.  Also, to be honest, coming up with variables names gets hard after a while.

One more thing, in JavaScript, you can only have 1 constructor defined. In other languages, you can have multiple constructors.

# Accessing Object Properties

To access an object property from within the class definition, you also will use *this* notation. You can treat it like a regular variable, in almost every sense, except for appending the name of the property with `this.`.

```js
class Person{
                constructor(eyeColor, hairColor)
                {
                    this.eyeColor = eyeColor;
                    this.hairColor = hairColor;
                }
                showInformation()
                {
                    document.getElementById("person").innerHTML = "Eye Color: " + this.eyeColor + "<br>Hair Color: " + this.hairColor;
                }
            }
        }
```

So, how do we create new objects from classes?
