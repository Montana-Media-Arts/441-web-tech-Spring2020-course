# Homework

In this homework assignment, you are going to create a virtual "ViewMaster" viewer.  It's up to you what you use as pictures, but it should contain not only the picture, but also, the name of the picture, a short description, the author of the picture, and the year it was taken.  

You are going to create a single class and you will create multiple objects from this class.  Each time the button is pressed, a new image, title, description, author, and year should appear.  

You should store all your objects in an array and you should pick a random object from your array to display.

Whew! That sounds like a lot. Let's break it down.

## Technical Specs

1. Create a single class
2. Create at least 5 different objects from that class with the following:
   1. Title
   2. Image
   3. Description
   4. Author
   5. Year image was taken - it can made up if you don't know
3. Store each object in a single array.
4. Have a button on the page
5. Every time the button is pressed, display a new randomly chosen object from your array.
