# Homework

In this homework, you are going to complete your memory matching game. You need an introduction page where you are going to first gather the player's first name, last name, their age, and their score.  You should store that in JSON, put it into local storage and then go to the memory matching page.

In that memory page, you will now allow the user to play the game.  You are to keep track of the how many attempts were required to complete the game.  When it's complete, then update the score in the JSON and then redirect the player to the final page where it shows their name, their age and their final score.

Specifics:

1. Page 1 - Gather first name, last name, age
2. Add all the information to JSON and include a score key.
3. Finish the memory matching game.
4. Keep track of how many attempts were made to complete the game.

6. On the final page, it should their name, their age and their attempts.
