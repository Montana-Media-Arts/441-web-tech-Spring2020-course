# Conclusions

This week focused on a couple of new elements in HTML5 particularly, the audio, video and canvas tags.  You were worked with drawing, keyevents and even collisions.  You know what that means?  You have the basics down for a game or some other kind of interactive art.  

I want you to know that I am really proud of all your hard work and I believe in each one of you!  Until next week!
