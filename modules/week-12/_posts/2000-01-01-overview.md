Quick note -- I am sorry; I mislabeled the videos originally as Week 11 because I forgot about Spring break.  I hope I don't cause any confusion!

What is HTML5?  Simply put, HTML5 is the successor of HTML4.  This semester, we have been working primarily with HTML4.  Most of those elements and tags still exist in HTML5.  However, HTML5 gives us a number new tags in which we can employ.  We will cover some of the new tags and how we can use them in our applications.  We will pay particular focus to the audio, video, and canvas tags as they will allow us to create web based games.
