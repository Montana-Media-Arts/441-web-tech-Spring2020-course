# HTML5

HTML5 is just the next iteration of HTML.  There are number of new tags used for specific purposes.  There are semantic tags such as the `header`, `footer`, `article`, and `section` tags which allow you to work with your layout in a more meaningful way.

There are some graphical tags such as `svg` and `canvas` which allow us to draw things to our web page.

There are media elements such as `audio` and `video` which allows to play music and video directly without using insecure and unsupported technologies like Flash or Java applets.  It also means we can reduce iframes of streamed content if we want.

Finally, there are new form element attributes such as `number`, `date`, `time`, `calendar`, and `range`.  This just adds more functionality to our forms without additional coding.
